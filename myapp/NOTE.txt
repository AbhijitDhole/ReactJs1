component:
1. Class component
-We have to use extends in class component to extend from Component just like inheritance in python
-And to render something we have to use render method
-Hooks are introduced in react 16 version and now we using 18th version and hooks cannot be applied in classComponent so its not prefered in the inductry

2. Functional component
- Easy to use adn hooks can be applied in the functional components

When we export more that one item from the component we cannot use default export, We have to use named export
export{username, password, Welcome}
